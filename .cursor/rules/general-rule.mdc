# General Rules

## Core Principles and Rules to Follow

- You must always commit your changes whenever you update code.
- You must always try to write code that is well documented (self-documenting or commented).
- You must only work on a single feature at a time.
- You must explain your decisions thoroughly to the user.

---

## Git Commit Conventions and Workflow Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

Use this format ([Conventional Commits v1.0.0](mdc:https:/www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0)):


```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Rules

- Header line must be 72 characters or less.
- Body lines should wrap at 100 characters.
- Use present tense, imperative mood: "add" not "added" or "adds".
- No period at end of description.
- Body should explain WHAT and WHY, not HOW.

### Standard Types

- `feat`: New feature for the user.
- `fix`: Bug fix for the user.
- `docs`: Documentation changes.
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc. (no code change).
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes bug nor adds feature.
- `test`: Adding or updating tests.
- `chore`: Build process, dependencies, tooling changes.
- `ci`: CI/CD configuration changes.
- `perf`: Performance improvements.
- `build`: Changes to build system or dependencies.
- `revert`: Reverting previous commits.

### Project-Specific Scopes

The scope should be the name of the component affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog).

- `frontend`: Next.js frontend changes.
- `api`: FastAPI backend changes.
- `ui`: UI components and styling.
- `auth`: Authentication related.
- `chat`: Chat functionality.
- `deploy`: Deployment configuration.
- `deps`: Dependency updates.
- `config`: Configuration files.

### Examples

```
feat(frontend): add streaming chat interface
fix(api): handle missing API key validation
docs(readme): update setup instructions
chore(deps): update Next.js to v14.1
style(ui): improve message bubble spacing
ci(deploy): add Vercel deployment workflow
```

---

## Branch Naming Convention

Branches should follow this pattern:

```
<type>(<scope>)/<short-description>
```

Example:

```
feat(api)/streaming-endpoint
```

---

## Workflow Guidelines

### 1. Protected Branches

- `main`: Production-ready code, protected branch.
- Direct commits to protected branches are NOT allowed.
- All changes must come through Pull Requests.

### 2. Feature Development

```bash
# First, check if you're on a protected branch
git branch --show-current

# If on main, create and checkout a new branch following <type>(<scope>)/<short-description>
git checkout -b feat(api)/streaming-endpoint main

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(api): add streaming chat endpoint"

# Keep branch updated with main
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main

# Push changes
git push origin feat(api)/streaming-endpoint
```

### 3. Pull Request Procedure

- Use the Pull Request Template when opening a pull request.
- The PR description must be written in valid **Markdown** and begin with:
  ```md
  <!-- @cursor format: markdown -->
  ```
- Request at least 2 code reviews (optional if solo).
- All tests must pass.
- No merge conflicts.
- Squash commits when merging.

@../templates/pull_request_template.md

### 4. Release Process

```bash
# Create release branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b release/v1.0.0

# After testing, merge back to main via PR
# After PR is approved and merged:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "version 1.0.0"
git push origin main --tags
```

## Git Workflow Automation

### Available Git Aliases

You can reference these efficient git aliases when helping with workflow tasks:

#### Basic Operations
- `git st` - Show status
- `git co <branch>` - Checkout branch
- `git br` - List branches

#### Feature Workflow
- `git new <branch-name>` - Create feature branch from latest main
- `git done <branch-name>` - Clean up after merge (switch to main, pull, delete branch)
- `git pushpr` - Push current branch for PR creation

#### Development Helpers
- `git wip` - Quick save work in progress
- `git amend` - Amend last commit without editing message
- `git undo` - Undo last commit (keeps changes staged)
- `git up` - Update current branch with latest main
- `git sync` - Switch to main and pull latest

#### Code Investigation
- `git find <text>` - Search for code changes containing text
- `git who <file>` - Show blame/authorship for file
- `git lg` - Pretty git log with graph

#### AI-Enhanced Commits
- `git smart-commit` - Use QodoGen for AI commit messages
- `git cursor-commit` - Stage changes and open Cursor editor for commit message creation
- `git ai-review` - Complete AI workflow (commit + push for PR)

### When Suggesting Git Commands

- **Prefer aliases** over full commands for efficiency
- **Suggest appropriate alias** based on the task
- **Explain the workflow** when using multi-step aliases
- **Reference conventional commit format** for commit messages

### Examples

Instead of:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat(api)/streaming-endpoint
```
Suggest:
```bash
git new feat(api)/streaming-endpoint
```

Instead of:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(api): add streaming endpoint"
git push origin feat(api)/streaming-endpoint
```
Suggest:
```bash
git add .
git cursor-commit  # Opens Cursor editor to create conventional commit message
git pushpr
```

## Workflow Automation Summary

For AI Engineer Challenge development:
1. **Start feature**: `git new feat(scope)/description`
2. **Save progress**: `git wip` (for breaks/experiments)
3. **Clean commit**: `git cursor-commit` (AI-assisted)
4. **Push for PR**: `git pushpr`
5. **Finish feature**: `git done feat(scope)/description`

This workflow combines conventional commits, AI assistance, and efficient automation.

### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes, add `!` after type/scope and include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer:
```
feat(api)!: change chat endpoint response format
BREAKING CHANGE: Response now returns streaming format instead of single response
```
