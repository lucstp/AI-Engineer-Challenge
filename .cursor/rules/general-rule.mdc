# General Rules

## Core Principles

- You must always commit your changes whenever you update code.
- You must always try to write code that is well documented (self-documenting or commented).
- You must only work on a single feature at a time.
- You must explain your decisions thoroughly to the user.

---

## Git Commit Conventions and Workflow Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

Use this format ([Conventional Commits v1.0.0](mdc:https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)):


```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Rules

- Header line must be 72 characters or less.
- Body lines should wrap at 100 characters.
- Use present tense, imperative mood: "add" not "added" or "adds".
- No period at end of description.
- Body should explain WHAT and WHY, not HOW.

### Standard Types

- `feat`: New feature for the user.
- `fix`: Bug fix for the user.
- `docs`: Documentation changes.
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc. (no code change).
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes bug nor adds feature.
- `test`: Adding or updating tests.
- `chore`: Build process, dependencies, tooling changes.
- `ci`: CI/CD configuration changes.
- `perf`: Performance improvements.
- `build`: Changes to build system or dependencies.
- `revert`: Reverting previous commits.

### Project-Specific Scopes

The scope should be the name of the component affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog).

- `frontend`: Next.js frontend changes.
- `api`: FastAPI backend changes.
- `ui`: UI components and styling.
- `auth`: Authentication related.
- `chat`: Chat functionality.
- `deploy`: Deployment configuration.
- `deps`: Dependency updates.
- `config`: Configuration files.

### Examples

```
feat(frontend): add streaming chat interface
fix(api): handle missing API key validation
docs(readme): update setup instructions
chore(deps): update Next.js to v14.1
style(ui): improve message bubble spacing
ci(deploy): add Vercel deployment workflow
```

---

## Branch Naming Convention

Branches should follow this pattern:

```
<type>(<scope>)/<short-description>
```

Example:

```
feat(api)/streaming-endpoint
```

---

## Workflow Guidelines

### 1. Protected Branches

- `main`: Production-ready code, protected branch.
- Direct commits to protected branches are NOT allowed.
- All changes must come through Pull Requests.

### 2. Feature Development

```bash
# First, check if you're on a protected branch
git branch --show-current

# If on main, create and checkout a new branch following <type>(<scope>)/<short-description>
git checkout -b feat(api)/streaming-endpoint main

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(api): add streaming chat endpoint"

# Keep branch updated with main
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main

# Push changes
git push origin feat(api)/streaming-endpoint
```

### 3. Pull Request Proceeature branch to main/master.
- Use the @Pull Request Tem.  
  _(If not visible, see @.github/pull_request_template.md)_
- Request at least 2 code reviews (optional if solo).
- All tests must pass.
- No merge conflicts.
- Squash commits when merging.

### 4. Release Process

```bash
# Create release branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b release/v1.0.0

# After testing, merge back to main via PR
# After PR is approved and merged:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "version 1.0.0"
git push origin main --tags
```

### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes, add `!` after type/scope and include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer:

```
feat(api)!: change chat endpoint response format

BREAKING CHANGE: Response now returns streaming format instead of single response
```
